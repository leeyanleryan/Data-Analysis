We utilised two different methods to optimize staff allocation to attractions in Subgroup B Q3. It used the forecasted wait times from Subgroup B Q1. For the example below, we are using the forecasts for 4th November 2024 and assume 50 total staff are allocated to handle the attractions, with 1 minimum staff per attraction.

The first method, Linear Optimization, requires us to define an objective function, along with constraints. The objective function is to minimise the total deviation from the target allocation. The three constraints are: sum of staff allocations across allocations must be less than or equal to the total number of staff, each ride must have at least the minimum number of required staff, and each ride's staff allocation needs to be close to its target allocation with some room for minor deviations.

The second method, Greedy Heuristic, was done similarly by defining an objective function with constraints. The objective function is to minimise the total wait time across all attractions, assuming that for every 1 additional staff allocated to an attraction, its wait time would be reduced by a factor. The two constraints are: sum of staff allocations across allocations must be less than or equal to the total number of staff and each ride must have at least the minimum number of required staff.

The optimal staff allocations for both methods can be seen below.

Linear Optimization is a popular mathematical model widely used by many businesses to find the best way to use their resources. In our case, since we can define our requirements linearly, it should theoretically produce the most optimal allocation. The downsides to this method is it assumes linear relationships, which may not be true for the problem we are dealing with. We cannot work with an objective function that works with reducing wait time, as it is illogical that adding 1 staff to an attraction would linearly reduce wait time. This means that the wait time can be reduced to 0 and in the negative range. Additionally, it cannot find feasible solutions at times given the constraints. This is why a more reliable method is necessary.

Greedy Heuristic is a general term for an algorithm that makes choices iteratively to achieve a goal, focusing on immediate gains instead of long-term consequences. In this method, 1 staff is assigned to the attraction with the highest wait time, reduce its wait time by a factor, then the process is repeated. This method is intuitive in its interpretation and is much more efficient timewise compared to Linear Optimization. It will also always find a solution. The downside is that it tends to find a local minimum/maximum, meaning that the solution can be suboptimal and not the most optimal. It also cannot undo an allocation it has made and keeps processing the next step. This means that it is unable to account for unforeseen consequences.

While there are clear advantages and disadvantages to both methods, the optimal allocation output for both still adhere to the same principle. They will prioritise and allocate more staff to the attractions with more wait time, and vice versa. Ideally, we should allocate more staff to the attraction with the highest wait time. If the queue for Revenge of the Mummy required a wait time of 1 hour, and we only allocated 5 staff to that attraction given by Linear Optimization, it likely won't be enough to process queues faster, entertain the guests in the queue and provide them with snacks. It would be better to allocate more, say 10, provided by Greedy Heuristic.

Thus, we recommend the method that allocates more staff to the attraction with the highest wait time. At some point, with an extremely high number of staff, the two methods intersect on the number of staff allocated to the attraction with the highest wait time. For those intersections, we would prefer Linear Optimization, as its distribution of allocation is much better and less uniform compared to the distribution of allocation from Greedy Heuristic. Although the choice of method is rather arbitrary, it is logical and aligns well with the business objectives of increasing guest satisfaction and revenue.
